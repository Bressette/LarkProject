It is the error of many philosophers that
they begin not with the observation of the
world as it surrounds us, but with a conclusion
already in mind; and often that conclusion is 
that the world is created ideal, and mankind itself
the greatest creation of the gods. Yet neither the
world nor the gods owe mankind perfection; it is 
arrogance to presume so, and contrary to all the
methods of philosophy. The honest philosopher seeks
only the truth, even if it bears no comfort; and
he must being by assuming as Socrates said, that
all he knows is that he knows nothing.
