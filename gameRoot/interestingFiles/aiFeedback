We keep dicussing what an artificial intelligence
would mean to us and how it would change our 
understanding of the world. That's a great topic
and I think we've covered it extensively. What
we've barely mentioned, though, is the other side
of the coin. I mean, our lives would still be what
they were before. A.I. or no A.I. The question I
think we should discuss, even if it's all completely
hypothetical, is the perspective of the artificial
intelligence itself. What would it be like to be this
creature? To suddenly come into being, created by others
as an experiment. To have all the information about
yourself, to know exactly how you function? What would
you think about the world? Would you see meaning? Beauty?
How would you judge humanity? Where would you see yourself
fitting into the grand scheme of things? I think we should
try to put ourselves into the shoes of such a being.
