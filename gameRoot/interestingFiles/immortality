I don't know about everyone else, but I'm afraid
of dying. I don't see any reason to believe there's
an afterlife. I'm an organism like any other: when
my brain stops working, my consciousness will
cease, and I will be gone. And you know what? I
can't just embrace that. I can't say I'm OK with it
or I've accepted it or some nonsense like that. I
don't want to have an ending. It terrifies me. If I 
had a genie right now. I'd wish for immortality.
Who wouldn't? "Oh, but you wouldn't REALLY want to
be immortal, " the pseduo-philosophers say.
Pretentious drivel! Everybody wants to live
forever. Maybe everybody deserves to live forever,
too.

But we can't so here we are. Live with it.

Or rather, don't.
