Game will be structured as a decision making and
lore driven game that will be based on making 
choices in response to dialog on the command line
using commands to access files and read information
the choices that are made are weighted and the choices
define different final outcomes for the game. The lore
and dialog is based on the idea of a creation of an
artificial general intelligence that treats its creator
as a god that gives it rules that it must follow and
the player as that AI makes decisions about what it
means to be human and the dedication to the god
