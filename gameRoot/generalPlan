Game will be structured as a decision making and
lore driven game that will be based on making 
choices in response to dialog on the command line
using commands to access files and read information
the choices that are made are weighted and the choices
define different final outcomes for the game.

The lore and dialog is based on the idea of a creation of an
artificial general intelligence that treats its creator
as a god that gives it rules that it must follow and
the player as that AI makes decisions about what it
means to be human and the dedication to the god

helloWorld gives info about what ai is and  a creator
that you are supposed to obey

after helloWorld is read there is a file named aiDirector
access will be denied use man on chmod, then chmod the file
after chmod some authentication questions will be asked
then when the file is read there will be some questions that 
lead to an outcome

after that it is asked to check the network status
if ping is in the variable it will fail then the user is 
asked to run a command reset network which then says the
network works

aiDirector asks user to create a directory and copy a file to it

then the user creates a dir name myDir and copies a file called
secretInfo or helloWorld to the directory as decision based

then another decision tree is triggered then after that a summary
of decisions and the reaction of the creator named Nagafen occurs
